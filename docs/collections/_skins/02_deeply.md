Developed by [Tophat Themes](https://themesguide.github.io/top-hat/dist/deeply/), you can use it on your site. Just go to your `_config.yml` file and modify this lines

```yaml
chulapa-skin: 
  theme       :  deeply
  autothemer  :  # Autotheming may not have any effect
  vars        :    
    ...
```


While `autothemer` does not override the skin, it may not be fully functional. You can modify the theme defaults via `vars`.
